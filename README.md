Introduction
============
With the improvement of technology, Human Machine Interaction (HMI) is getting more and more important. In order to interact with mobile devices and computers, static keys/buttons, track path devices and touch screens have developed respectively.  We believe that the next concept of HMI will let people use computers or mobile devices without touching.  Gesture recognition and motion tracking are the next improvement of interaction with mobile devices. 

Controlling Mobile Devices is not an easy task while driving car or mobile device is located away from user via touching screen or pushing button. Our Gesture Recognition System will be the solution of getting out of an obligation of touching the screen or pushing the buttons of mobile phones in order to make a call, control the menu, take a picture etc. By detecting the hand movements of human body, there will be no necessity of touching on mobile phones. 

We know that some applications related with gesture recognition are available for computers. However, logic of Controlling  a robot  using  hand human gestures  and then making them perform any  function can been used in many other heavy work practical applications.  Due to all of these reasons,   development of this .Gesture Recognizing  Robot.  will be a breakthrough innovation.
